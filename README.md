# dzil-minting-profiles

This is just a backup of the minting profiles I use with
Dist::Zilla. What I'd really like is a fancy Author::PluginBundle, but
I haven't the slightest clue how to go about creating one of those. On
the other hand, it's pretty easy to find a few tutorials on creating a
custom minting profile:

Oh! Perhaps this will be of interest the next time I feel like futzing
with this stuff:
